# Github-Scraper

Hi! everyone and welcome to  **Github-Scraper**. Here i have coded a very simple script that logs in to your github account using **[Selenium]**(https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)


# Installation

1 - To make it work you'll need  to install packages from `req.txt`.
2 - Add your password in the code in encoded form.
3 - Run this file from the terminal `python github.py`
## Password encoding

`>>>import base64`
`>>>print(base64.b64encode(b'Your password'))`
`>>>encoded password`
