# Github-Scraper

Hi! everyone and welcome to  **Github-Scraper**. Here i have coded a very simple script that logs in to your github account using **[Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)**


# Installation

-   To make it work you'll need  to install packages from `req.txt`.

- Add your password in the code in encoded form.

- Run this file from the terminal `python github.py`
## Password encoding


```
>>>import base64
>>>print(base64.b64encode(b'Your password'))`
>>>encoded password```
